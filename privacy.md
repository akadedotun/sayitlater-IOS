# Privacy Policy for Say It Later

**Last updated: January 2026**

## Introduction

Say It Later is a privacy-first iOS application designed to give you a private space to write thoughts you are not ready to say out loud. Your privacy is fundamental to how the app is built and how it works.

⸻

## Core Privacy Principles

- Everything stays on your device
- No accounts, no servers, no tracking
- No data leaves your phone

⸻

## Data Collection

### What We Do Not Collect

Say It Later does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data.

Specifically:
- No account or sign-up information
- No names, email addresses, or identifiers
- No analytics or usage tracking
- No location data
- No advertising identifiers
- No third-party SDKs

The app does not connect to any external servers.

⸻

## Data Stored on Your Device

All data is stored locally on your device using Apple's native frameworks.

This includes:
- Your written entries
- Entry metadata such as date and selected feelings
- Safety flags used only for on-device support prompts
- App preferences, including Face ID or passcode lock settings

No data is synced, uploaded, or backed up outside your device.

⸻

## Security

- **Local encryption**: Data is protected using iOS system-level encryption
- **Face ID / Passcode**: If enabled, authentication is handled entirely by Apple's LocalAuthentication framework
- **Keychain**: Lock preferences are stored securely in the iOS Keychain

Say It Later never accesses or stores biometric data.

⸻

## Support Resources

If certain content suggests distress, the app may show support resources.

**Region detection:**
- Happens locally on your device
- Is not stored or transmitted
- Is used only to display relevant support information

Opening support links will take you to external websites that are not controlled by Say It Later.

⸻

## Children's Privacy

Say It Later is not intended for children under the age of 13. The app does not knowingly collect information from children.

⸻

## Your Rights

Because all data is stored locally:
- **Access**: You can view everything directly in the app
- **Deletion**: You can delete entries at any time
- **Uninstall**: Removing the app deletes all stored data
- **Export**: Export features may be added in future versions

⸻

## Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy changes, the "Last updated" date will be revised. No silent changes.

⸻

## Contact

If you have questions about privacy or how the app works, you can reach us through the app's support contact.

⸻

## Compliance

Say It Later is designed to comply with:
- GDPR
- CCPA
- Apple App Store Review Guidelines

Because no personal data is collected or transmitted, user privacy rights are inherently respected.

⸻

**In short:**
Everything you write stays on your device.
Nothing is tracked.
Nothing is shared.
