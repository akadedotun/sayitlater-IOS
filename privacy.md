# Privacy Policy for Say It Later

**Last Updated: January 2026**

## Introduction

Say It Later is a privacy-first iOS application designed to provide a private space for users to write thoughts they are not ready to vocalize. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Core Privacy Principles

**Everything stays on your device.** Say It Later is built with privacy as the foundation. We do not collect, transmit, or store your data on any servers.

## Data Collection

### What We Don't Collect

- **No account information**: Say It Later does not require accounts or user registration.
- **No personal data**: We do not collect names, email addresses, or any identifying information.
- **No usage analytics**: We do not track how you use the app, what you write, or when you use it.
- **No location data**: While the app may detect your region to show appropriate support resources, this detection happens locally and is never stored or transmitted.
- **No network activity**: The app does not send any data over the internet, except when you explicitly choose to:
  - Load images from external URLs (splash screen, icons)
  - Open external links (support resources)

### What We Store Locally

All data is stored exclusively on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework:

- **Your entries**: The text you write is stored locally in your device's database.
- **Entry metadata**: Date, feeling selection, and safety flags are stored locally.
- **App preferences**: Settings like Face ID/passcode lock preferences are stored locally using Apple's Keychain.

## Data Sharing

**We do not share your data with anyone.** Your entries and preferences never leave your device. We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties because we don't collect it in the first place.

## External Services

Say It Later may display:
- **Support resource links**: When you access support resources, links may open in your browser. These are external services not controlled by Say It Later.
- **Images**: Some images are loaded from external URLs (Cloudinary) for app icons and illustrations. These are static images only.

## Security

- **Local storage**: All data is encrypted at rest using iOS's built-in encryption.
- **Face ID/Passcode**: If you enable Face ID or passcode lock, authentication is handled by Apple's LocalAuthentication framework. We do not have access to your biometric data.
- **Keychain**: Lock preferences are stored securely in iOS Keychain.

## Support Resources

Say It Later may show region-appropriate support resources based on your device's locale. This detection:
- Happens locally on your device
- Is not stored or transmitted
- Is used only to display relevant support information

## Children's Privacy

Say It Later is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- **Access**: You can access all your data directly in the app.
- **Deletion**: You can delete entries at any time through the app.
- **Export**: Export functionality may be available in future versions.
- **Uninstall**: Uninstalling the app removes all local data.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us through the app's support resources or your preferred method of communication.

## Compliance

Say It Later is designed to comply with:
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- Apple's App Store guidelines

Since we do not collect, transmit, or store personal data, the app inherently respects user privacy rights.

**Remember**: Everything you write stays on your device. Nothing is shared. Nothing is tracked.
