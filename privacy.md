# Privacy Policy for Say It Later

**Last updated: January 2026**

## Introduction

Say It Later is a privacy-first iOS application that provides a private space for writing thoughts you are not ready to say out loud. This privacy policy explains how data is handled when you use the app.

⸻

## Core privacy principles

**Everything you write stays on your device.**

Say It Later does not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to our servers.

⸻

## Data collection

### What we do not collect
- No accounts or registration
- No names, email addresses, or identifiers
- No analytics or usage tracking
- No behavioural profiling
- No stored location data

The app may detect your device's region locally to show relevant support resources. This detection happens entirely on your device and is not stored or transmitted.

⸻

## Local data storage

All user-created content is stored exclusively on your device using Apple system frameworks.

This includes:
- Text entries you write
- Entry metadata such as date, reflection selection, and safety flags
- App preferences, including Face ID or passcode lock settings

Authentication preferences are stored securely using Apple's Keychain.

⸻

## External services

### Static images
The app loads a small number of static images (currently four) from Cloudinary.
These images are used only for visual presentation.
- No user-generated content is uploaded
- No personal data is transmitted
- No tracking or analytics are enabled

Cloudinary may process basic technical information (such as IP address) in accordance with its own privacy policy when images are loaded.

⸻

### Support resources
The app may provide links to external support resources. When opened, these links are handled by your browser and governed by the privacy policies of those services.

⸻

## Data sharing

Say It Later does not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.

Your written content never leaves your device.

⸻

## Security
- All local data is protected using iOS's built-in encryption
- Face ID and passcode authentication are handled entirely by Apple's LocalAuthentication framework
- The app does not access or store biometric data

## Support and safety information

The app may display region-appropriate support resources based on your device's locale. This process:
